THINGS TO IMPLIMENT


Create Treasure falling class and object

Allow hit detection for trash and treasure

Create score keeper, for when treasure or trash is hit.
    Maybe end the game when a certain amount of trash is hit? idk how its supposed to work

Make the objects look cooler?

Make the falling objects fall at better time intervals, and maybe make them bigger so easier to dodge.
